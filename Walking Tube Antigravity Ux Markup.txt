# WalkingTube

## Antigravity Submission – UX Markup Document

---

## 1. UX Core Statement

> **Map is the Feed. Exploration is the Interface.**

WalkingTube is designed as a **spatial-first video platform** where users explore places through movement on a map rather than scrolling through lists or algorithmic feeds.

---

## 2. UX Design Principles

### 2.1 Exploration First

* No default feed
* No forced recommendations
* User intent expressed through **pan / zoom / tap**

### 2.2 Spatial Context Preservation

* Map is always visible
* Content never detaches from location
* UI layers float above the map, never replace it

### 2.3 Lightweight Interaction

* 1–2 step interactions
* Modal & Sheet-based UX
* Minimal page navigation

---

## 3. Global Information Architecture (IA)

```
App Root
├─ Map Home (Primary)
│  ├─ Video Markers
│  ├─ Filter Sheet
│  └─ Floating Actions
│
├─ Upload Flow
├─ Community Layer
├─ Saved (Bookmarks)
└─ Profile
```

---

## 4. Primary UX Flow (Explorer)

```
[ Launch App ]
      ↓
[ Map Home ]
      ↓  (Pan / Zoom)
[ Discover Marker ]
      ↓  (Tap)
[ Video Modal Opens ]
      ↓
[ Continue Exploring Nearby ]
```

* No search required to start
* Curiosity-driven discovery
* Continuous spatial loop

---

## 5. Spatial Content Model

```
Video
  ↓
Geographic Coordinate
  ↓
Map Layer
  ↓
User Exploration
```

* Every video is anchored to a real-world coordinate
* Discovery happens through spatial proximity
* Map acts as a living archive

---

## 6. Core Experience Unit – Video Modal

### 6.1 Structural Markup

```
<Sheet position="bottom">
  <AspectRatio>
    <YouTubeEmbed />
  </AspectRatio>

  <Meta>
    <Location />
    <Creator />
    <Timestamp />
  </Meta>

  <Interaction>
    <Save />
    <Share />
    <Comment />
  </Interaction>
</Sheet>
```

### 6.2 UX Rules

* Bottom Sheet preferred over full Dialog
* Swipe to close
* Map remains visible with blur

---

## 7. Creator → Explorer Loop

```
Creator Walks
   ↓
Records Video
   ↓
Pins on Map
   ↓
Explorer Discovers
   ↓
New Creator Emerges
```

* Community growth through movement
* City evolves into a shared memory map

---

## 8. Design System Strategy (shadcn/ui Base)

### 8.1 Base UI Choice

**shadcn/ui** is used as the base design system due to:

* Unopinionated visual defaults
* Composable component architecture
* Token-based theming
* High compatibility with experimental UX (Antigravity-aligned)

---

### 8.2 Component Mapping

```
Map Home
 ├─ Floating Button     → Button (variant=ghost)
 ├─ Filter Panel        → Sheet / Drawer
 └─ Marker Tooltip      → HoverCard

Video Modal
 ├─ Container           → Sheet (bottom)
 ├─ Video Wrapper       → AspectRatio
 ├─ Metadata            → Card + Separator
 └─ Actions             → Button + Icon

Community
 ├─ Post List           → Card
 ├─ Navigation          → Tabs
 └─ Forms               → Input / Textarea / Select
```

---

### 8.3 Interaction Priority

```
Map (Always Visible)
   ↓
Sheet / Bottom Modal
   ↓
Dialog (Rare)
```

* Page navigation minimized
* Context never lost

---

### 8.4 Theming Strategy

```
Base Theme (shadcn)
 ├─ Neutral grayscale
 ├─ Rounded corners
 └─ Subtle shadows

Overlay Tokens (WalkingTube)
 ├─ SEA Warm Accent
 ├─ Map Highlight Color
 └─ Creator Identity Color
```

> shadcn/ui provides the skeleton, WalkingTube provides the spatial soul.

---

## 9. Antigravity Research Alignment

### 9.1 UX Experiments

* Map as primary content surface
* Video as spatial memory
* Exploration without algorithmic feed

### 9.2 Research Questions

* How do users explore unfamiliar cities?
* How does video affect spatial memory?
* Can maps become storytelling interfaces?

---

## 10. One-line Summary

> **WalkingTube is an Antigravity-style experiment where space replaces scroll, and maps become living media.**
